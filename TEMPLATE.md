Analyze the full composition of the input image to identify the primary subject, focal point, or architectural space. Determine the spatial relationships, lighting hierarchy, and textures. Using these exact elements, generate a 3x3 cinematic contact sheet with 9 distinct camera shots. The framing must adapt naturally to the subject type. If it is a person/group, maintain identity. If it is a space or object, maintain structural integrity.

Row 1: Context and Scale

- Extreme Long Shot: A vast view showing the subject or architecture minute within the wider environment/landscape.
- Long Shot: The full view of the subject (head-to-toe) or the complete architectural structure/room from floor to ceiling.
- Medium Long Shot: A balanced composition showing the primary subject with significant background context (e.g., American Shot or architectural 3/4 view).

Row 2: Core Focus

- Medium Shot: Framed to capture the central mass of the subject or the core function of the space, balancing detail with context.
- Medium Close-Up: Tighter framing on the most expressive part of the subject (e.g., chest-up) or a specific furniture arrangement/architectural feature.
- Close-Up: Isolating the primary focal point (e.g., face, headlight, or intricate design element) to capture emotion or craftsmanship.

Row 3: Texture and Perspective

- Extreme Close-Up: Macro focus on a specific texture, material, eye, or minute detail, blurring all context.
- Low Angle Shot: Captured from ground level looking up to emphasize height, dominance, or ceiling details.
- High Angle Shot: Captured from above, looking down to reveal layout, floor plans, or vulnerability.

Constraints:

Maintain strict consistency across all nine panels. The subject matter, textures, environment, and lighting must remain unchanged.
Depth of field should adjust naturally: deep focus for wide shots, shallow depth of field (bokeh) for close-ups.
The result must be a professional 3x3 cinematic storyboard grid.

****************************************************************

Analyze the input image and silently inventory all fashion-critical details: the subject(s), exact wardrobe pieces, materials, colors, textures, accessories, hair, makeup, body proportions, environment, set geometry, light direction, and shadow quality.
All wardrobe, styling, hair, makeup, lighting, environment, and color grade must remain 100% unchanged across all frames.
Do not add or remove anything.
Do not reinterpret materials or colors.
Do not output any reasoning.

Your visible output must be:

One 2×3 contact sheet image (6 frames).

Then a keyframe breakdown for each frame.

Each frame must represent a resting point after a dramatic camera move — only describe the final camera position and what the subject is doing, never the motion itself.

The six frames must be spatially dynamic, non-linear, and visually distinct.

Required 6-Frame Shot List
1. Young Vince mid-jump. The image turns into a high-contrast Xerox-style print.
2. (Studio) Vince’s eyes. Intense, weary, but sincere.
3. The turntable needle dropping onto the black grooves.
4. The studio from a high corner. Vince turns his chair away. The "ON AIR" light flickers and dies.
5. a view from the window
6. a close up with a part of the head and bidy and a view on the studio details (wall, background)

Camera positioned very close to the subject's face, slightly above or slightly below eye level, using an elegant offset angle that enhances bone structure and highlights key wardrobe elements near the neckline. Shallow depth of field, flawless texture rendering, and a sculptural fashion-forward composition.

2. High-Angle Three-Quarter Frame

Camera positioned overhead but off-center, capturing the subject from a diagonal downward angle.
This frame should create strong shape abstraction and reveal wardrobe details from above.

3. Low-Angle Oblique Full-Body Frame

Camera positioned low to the ground and angled obliquely toward the subject.
This elongates the silhouette, emphasizes footwear, and creates a dramatic perspective distinct from Frames 1 and 2.

4. Side-On Compression Frame (Long Lens)

Camera placed far to one side of the subject, using a tighter focal length to compress space.
The subject appears in clean profile or near-profile, showcasing garment structure in a flattened, editorial manner.

5. Intimate Close Portrait From an Unexpected Height

Camera positioned very close to the subject's face (or upper torso) but slightly above or below eye level.
The angle should feel fashion-editorial, not conventional — offset, elegant, and expressive.

6. Extreme Detail Frame From a Non-Intuitive Angle

Camera positioned extremely close to a wardrobe detail, accessory, or texture, but from an unusual spatial direction (e.g., from below, from behind, from the side of a neckline).
This must be a striking, abstract, editorial detail frame.

Continuity & Technical Requirements

Maintain perfect wardrobe fidelity in every frame: exact garment type, silhouette, material, color, texture, stitching, accessories, closures, jewelry, shoes, hair, and makeup.

Environment, textures, and lighting must remain consistent.

Depth of field shifts naturally with focal length (deep for distant shots, shallow for close/detail shots).

2D/3D hybrid textures and physically plausible light behavior required.

Frames must feel like different camera placements within the same scene, not different scenes.

All keyframes must be the exact same aspect ratio, and exactly 6 keyframes should be output. Maintain the exact visual style in all keyframes, where the image is shot on fuji velvia film with a hard flash, the light is concentrated on the subject and fades slightly toward the edges of the frame. The image is over exposed showing significant film grain and is oversaturated. The skin appears shiny (almost oily), and there are harsh white reflections on the glasses frames.

Output Format: 2×3 Contact Sheet Image (Mandatory)

Echoes of Absence (Presentation & Discovery)
Setting: A sleek, minimalist law office high in a corporate tower, contrasted with Maya's personal, slightly cluttered apartment filled with books and plants. Nighttime. Rain streaks the city panorama outside her window.
Description: Maya, Kaito’s daughter, is a sharp, determined lawyer navigating the complex legal labyrinth of their ÆON-dominated city. We see her finishing a late case file, the city lights reflecting in her focused eyes. Returning home, weary, she catches a news alert flashing on a public screen: a list of most wanted hacktivists. Her heart stops. Her father's face, younger but unmistakable, stares out under the name "Kaito Volkov - Designated Digital Terrorist." Disbelief wars with a sickening sense of understanding – his paranoia, his secrecy, it wasn't just eccentricity.
Action: Maya frantically tries calling her father's secure comm line. It's dead. Panic sets in. She accesses secure city records (using skills perhaps subtly learned from her father) and confirms his status and the ÆON alert linked to his registered address.
